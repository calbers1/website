  <div class="about">
    <p>
      I am a Computer Science graduate from Harding University. I love to
      program, build computers, cook, make knives, and read. I've been married
      to my wonderful wife, Madeleine, since January 3rd, 2020, and we have been
      foster parents since September of 2021. However, we are currently empty
      nesters at age 24.<br />

      My first language was C++, but my interest lies in front end web
      development. I'm currently working on expanding my knowledge of React, so
      that I can create and contribute to high quality front-end projects that
      will make someone's day better. I'm really looking to join a company where
      I can learn and grow explosively, and make a difference with my work.
